              <h3>Vission</h3>
              <p class="box-text">With a personal vision, i will be able to work within something we call the balance cycle rather than in a stress cycle. In the balance cycle, i will be more satisfied, more productive, and experience more meaning and enjoyment. In comparison, without a personal vision, i could end up in the stress cycle where i experience more burnout and often feel as though my efforts are wasted and lack meaning</p>
